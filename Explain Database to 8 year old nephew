A database is like a box - where you can put things you want to remember and get them back whenever 
you need it. You can organize the box any way you like, so there are many little compartments for 
different things you want to remember.
It also can tell you quickly how many total things you have, and many other questions.


A database is like your crayon box. 
If you open it, you see all the green ones together, all the red ones together, all the yellow ones together. 
When you put a crayon in the box, it has to go with the same colors just like a database.
Its not perfect, but I think a child would understand
